# Contentful CMS

We rely on
[Contentful Content Management System (CMS)](https://www.contentful.com/) as a
user-friendly way to handle the content shown by the app without changes of the
application source code.

For introduction into Contentful-related development look into
[this article](https://github.com/topcoder-platform/community-app/wiki/Integration)
(should be moved into the main repo in future).
